# m2npcoin: A Platform Token for m2np

Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of Social Network currency would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another with/without going through m2np.com. ERC20 provides part of the solution, while m2np.com will be responsible for small transactions with little/no fee.

## Token Nature:

We forge a fixed amount of m2np coin to 1000000000000000.0000000000000000 (16 integer places and 16 decimal places)
We initially hold all the amount of the coin, and with a smart contract with the following limits:
1. burnable (Burn is an action describing a certain part of the whole pool is being removed forever)
  - tokens are burnt after the transaction for getting the m2np.com VIP services (so that: you spend just to make m2np more socially recognizable, we don't earn from your spending to use m2np.com.)
2. No minting
3. On ERC20 MAINNET (Ethereum as gas)

### Future Plan:
1. We also seek Layer2 solutions at the time that we recognize any of the L2 DEX projects is stable.

## Potential Problems and solutions:
1. High on-chain transaction fee on Layer 1.
  - We provide a free/little-charge centralized exchange on m2np.com
  - You can get a small amount from other users on m2np.com
  - for off-site transactions, we may link it to layer2 at a suitable time.
2. Security problem of central exchange
  - There is no 100% safe or provable solution for this problem
  - We keep offline backup records of transactions, before on-chain transactions, we can try to get the human consensus of the current financial distribution status is not just after a disaster. or otherwise, we can do a rewind.
  - Exchange is isolated and open-source.
3. It is too slow to use up all the coins
  - We set the price of VIP and transaction according to a ratio to market price in the exchange, this also makes our expenses can be covered more realistically.

## How to get/distribute m2np token:
It is still under discussion.
1. we air-drop distribute through a proof of human existence by some SNS sites. (like the way of HNS)
2. we sell them on the exchange.
3. we sell them over-the-counter.
